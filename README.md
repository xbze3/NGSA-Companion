# NGSA-Dataset

A structured, open dataset of NGSA past papers (paper 1 question and answers), compiled for educational and non-commercial use. Includes multiple choice questions, answers, and metadata in JSON format for easy integration.

## Why I Created This

I wanted this data for a personal project, but couldn’t find it on the Ministry of Education’s website, so I built it myself. I'm sharing it so others (teachers, developers, students) can benefit too.
